# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Studio84 Pottery
tagline: Unique pottery from the Maine coast
description: I am a ceramic artist living in Harpswell on the coast of Maine.  I work primarily on the wheel, making functional pottery decorated with carving, alteration, slip, or handbuilt elements.  I use white stoneware and fire to cone 6 in an electric kiln. I am continually exploring shape and form, making each piece unique.
