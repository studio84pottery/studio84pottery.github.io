I am a ceramic artist living on the coast of Maine.  I work primarily on the wheel, making functional pottery decorated with carving, alteration, slip, or handbuilt elements.  I use white stoneware and fire to cone 6 in an electric kiln. I am continually exploring shape and form, making each piece unique.

My work is for sale at Studio84 at 84 Bethel Point Road in Cundyâ€™s Harbor, Harpswell and I am available for commissions.
